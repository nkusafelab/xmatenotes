<!--Once you define the custom attributes, you can use them in layout XML files just like built-in attributes.
The only difference is that your custom attributes belong to a different namespace.
You can define the namespace within the root view of the layout and configure the properties for the view.
Normally you would need to specify a namespace such as http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/<package_name>
(i.e. com.codepath.example.customviewdemo)
but the namespace http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto will auto-resolve for you.-->
